title: About Me â€¢ Fernando Aspiazu
---

**Letâ€™s start as if this were a typical Workday employee registration!**

My full name is *Fernando Andres Aspiazu Hurtado* (yes, quite a mouthful!), but you can simply call me **Fernando Aspiazu**.

I was born in Ecuador ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ in 1987 and lived there until I turned 18. In 2005, I moved to Italy where Iâ€™ve been ever since and becoming Italian citizen ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ðŸ¤Œ in 2018 after a long wait to meet all the requirements.

In Ecuador, I graduated in Computer Science from my beloved school [**Liceo Cristiano de Guayaquil**](https://liceocristiano.edu.ec/). Thatâ€™s where I discovered my passion for putting my fingers on the keyboard and creating anything possible with whatever programming language was in front of me. After all, my top grades were in Programming Languages and Flowchart Techniques â€” which says it all! ðŸ™„

In Italy, although I was eager to complete another degree, I havenâ€™t achieved that goal yet â€” but I havenâ€™t lost hope of doing so someday.

My career began in 2011, working with Java and Spring, building full end-to-end solutions from databases to front-end. As I progressed, I realized that my true passion lies in backend development.

In 2016, I stepped into the world of functional programming, learning and working with Scala â€” and I can confidently say, even today (June 2025), that it is the best programming language I have ever used.

In my two most recent roles, Iâ€™ve also found great enjoyment working in Data Engineering and System Architecture, which allowed me to broaden my perspective beyond coding alone and to consider wider organizational and business aspects.

Currently, Iâ€™m working at Guccio Gucci _(yes, the luxury brand!)_ as a Software Engineer.
